# Postman MCP Generator

Welcome to your generated MCP server! üöÄ

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/ma3u/dust-mcp-server-postman-railway](https://github.com/ma3u/dust-mcp-server-postman-railway) This project was created with the [Postman MCP Generator](https://postman.com/explore/mcp-generator), configured to [Model Context Provider (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) Server output mode. It provides you with:

- ‚úÖ An MCP-compatible server (`mcpServer.js`)
- ‚úÖ Automatically generated JavaScript tools for each selected Postman API request

Let's set things up!

## üö¶ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:

- [Node.js (v18+ required, v20+ recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node)

Warning: if you run with a lower version of Node, `fetch` won't be present. Tools use `fetch` to make HTTP calls. To work around this, you can modify the tools to use `node-fetch` instead. Make sure that `node-fetch` is installed as a dependency and then import it as `fetch` into each tool file.

### üì• Installation & Setup

**1. Install dependencies**

Run from your project's root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

## üöÄ Starting the MCP Server

To start the MCP server, run the following command from your project's root directory:

```sh
node mcpServer.js
```

You should see output similar to:

```plaintext
[MCP Server] Starting server...
[MCP Server] Discovering tools...
[MCP Server] Discovered 18 tools
[MCP Server] Available tools: [
  'list_workspace_vaults',
  'list_assistants',
  'list_data_source_views',
  'get_conversation_events',
  'get_data_sources',
  'search_assistants_by_name',
  'get_conversation',
  'retrieve_document',
  'get_app_run',
  'get_events_for_message',
  'upsert_document',
  'get_documents',
  'create_conversation',
  'create_message',
  'create_content_fragment',
  'create_app_run',
  'search_data_source',
  'search_data_source_view'
]
[MCP Server] Starting in stdio mode...
[MCP Server] Connecting server to transport...
[MCP Server] Server connected and ready
[MCP Server] Send a JSON-RPC message to interact with the server
```

## üîç Testing with JSON-RPC

Once the server is running, you can send it JSON-RPC requests. Here's how to test it using `curl`:

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Send a JSON-RPC request to list available tools:

```sh
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "mcp_discover", "params": {}}' | nc localhost 3000
```

Or to call a specific tool (example with `list_assistants`):

```sh
echo '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "list_assistants",
  "params": {}
}' | nc localhost 3000
```

Note: Make sure you have `netcat` (`nc`) installed. If not, you can install it using:
- On macOS: `brew install netcat`
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install netcat`

### üîê Set tool environment variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage environment-specific variables, such as API keys. To get started:

1. **Create your environment file**: Copy the example environment file to a new file named `.env`:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update API Keys**: Open the newly created `.env` file. You'll see placeholder environment variables for the Dust API:

   ```env
   DUST_API_KEY=
   DUST_WORKSPACE_ID=
   DUST_AGENT_ID=
   ```

   Update these lines with your actual Dust API Key, Workspace ID, and Agent ID. These environment variables are used by the tools to interact with the Dust API. You can inspect the files in the `tools` directory to see how they are used.

```javascript
// environment variables are used inside of each tool file
const apiKey = process.env.DUST_API_KEY;
const workspaceId = process.env.DUST_WORKSPACE_ID;
// etc.
```

**Note:** The generated tools will need to be configured to use these specific environment variables (`DUST_API_KEY`, `DUST_WORKSPACE_ID`, `DUST_AGENT_ID`). If the tools were generated for a different API or expect different environment variable names, you will need to manually update the JavaScript files in the `tools/` directory to use these variables correctly for authentication and API calls.

## üåê Testing the MCP Server with Postman

Postman provides a user-friendly interface to test your MCP server. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Install the latest [Postman Desktop Application](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- Node.js v18+ installed
- Your MCP server project dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### Step 1: Create a New MCP Request

1. Open Postman
2. Click "New" > "MCP Request"
3. In the new tab, you'll see the MCP request configuration

### Step 2: Configure the MCP Server

1. Set the request type to `STDIO`
2. In the command field, enter the full path to Node.js followed by the full path to `mcpServer.js`:

   ```sh
   /Users/ma3u/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node /Users/ma3u/projects/postman-dust-mcp-server/mcpServer.js
   ```

   To find these paths on your system:

   ```sh
   # Get Node.js path
   which node
   
   # Get absolute path to mcpServer.js (run from your project directory)
   pwd
   # Then append "/mcpServer.js" to the output
   ```

### Step 3: Start the Server

1. Click the "Connect" button in Postman
2. You should see the server start up in the terminal at the bottom of the screen
3. Once connected, you'll see a list of available tools in the response section

### Step 4: Test a Tool

1. In the request body, enter a JSON-RPC request. For example, to list assistants:

   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "id": 1,
     "method": "list_assistants",
     "params": {}
   }
   ```

2. Click "Send" to execute the request
3. View the response in the lower panel

### Available Tools

You can call any of the following tools directly by name in the `method` field:

- `list_workspace_vaults` - List all workspace vaults
- `list_assistants` - List available assistants
- `list_data_source_views` - List data source views
- `get_conversation_events` - Get conversation events
- `get_data_sources` - Get available data sources
- `search_assistants_by_name` - Search for assistants by name
- `get_conversation` - Get conversation details
- `retrieve_document` - Retrieve a document
- `get_app_run` - Get application run details
- `get_events_for_message` - Get events for a specific message
- `upsert_document` - Create or update a document
- `get_documents` - Get multiple documents
- `create_conversation` - Start a new conversation
- `create_message` - Send a message
- `create_content_fragment` - Create a content fragment
- `create_app_run` - Start a new application run
- `search_data_source` - Search within a data source
- `search_data_source_view` - Search within a data source view

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Server Not Starting**
   - Verify Node.js is installed and in your PATH
   - Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
   - Look for error messages in the Postman Notifications tab

2. **Connection Timeouts**
   - Ensure the server is running before making requests
   - Try restarting the server if it becomes unresponsive
   - Check that no other process is using the required port

3. **Invalid Method Errors**
   - Use tool names exactly as listed in the "Available Tools" section
   - Don't add prefixes like `mcp.` or `rpc.` to method names
   - Ensure the `params` field is an empty object `{}`

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Verify `.env` file exists and contains required variables
   - Ensure environment variables are properly loaded
   - Check for typos in variable names

5. **Server Logs**
   - Check the Postman Notifications tab for server output
   - Look for error messages or stack traces
   - The server logs all incoming requests and errors

#### Restarting the Server

If you encounter issues, try these steps:

1. Click the "Disconnect" button in Postman
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Click "Connect" to restart the server
4. Try your request again

#### Node Version Issues

- Make sure you're using Node.js v18 or higher
- You can specify the full path to a specific Node.js version if needed
- If using nvm, ensure you're using the correct Node.js version:
  ```sh
  nvm use 18  # or your preferred version
  ```

#### Tool Execution Errors

- Check the Postman console for detailed error messages
- Verify that all required parameters are included in your request

### Example: Listing Data Sources

Here's how to list all data sources:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "list_data_sources",
  "params": {}
}
```

### Next Steps

Once you've verified the server works in Postman, you can integrate it with other MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

```sh
realpath mcpServer.js
```

Use the node command followed by the full path to `mcpServer.js` as the command for your new Postman MCP Request. Then click the **Connect** button. You should see a list of tools that you selected before generating the server. You can test that each tool works here before connecting the MCP server to an LLM.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Connect the MCP Server to Claude

You can connect your MCP server to any MCP client. Here we provide instructions for connecting it to Claude Desktop.

**Step 1**: Note the full path to node and the `mcpServer.js` from the previous step.

**Step 2**. Open Claude Desktop ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Edit Config** and add a new MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server_name>": {
      "command": "<absolute/path/to/node>",
      "args": ["<absolute/path/to/mcpServer.js>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to activate this change. Make sure the new MCP is turned on and has a green circle next to it. If so, you're ready to begin a chat session that can use the tools you've connected.

**Warning**: If you don't supply an absolute path to a `node` version that is v18+, Claude (and other MCP clients) may fall back to another `node` version on the system of a previous version. In this case, the `fetch` API won't be present and tool calls will not work. If that happens, you can a) install a newer version of node and point to it in the command, or b) import `node-fetch` into each tool as `fetch`, making sure to also add the `node-fetch` dependency to your package.json.

### Additional Options

#### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Production)

For production deployments, you can use Docker:

**1. Build Docker image**

```sh
docker build -t <your_server_name> .
```

**2. Claude Desktop Integration**

Add Docker server configuration to Claude Desktop (Settings ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<your_server_name>": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--env-file=.env", "<your_server_name>"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Add your environment variables (API keys, etc.) inside the `.env` file.

The project comes bundled with the following minimal Docker setup:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.12-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "mcpServer.js"]
```

#### üåê Server-Sent Events (SSE)

To run the server with Server-Sent Events (SSE) support, use the `--sse` flag:

```sh
node mcpServer.js --sse
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional CLI commands

#### List tools

List descriptions and parameters from all generated tools with:

```sh
node index.js tools
```

Example:

```
Available Tools:

Workspace: acme-workspace
  Collection: useful-api
    list_all_customers
      Description: Retrieve a list of useful things.
      Parameters:
        - magic: The required magic power
